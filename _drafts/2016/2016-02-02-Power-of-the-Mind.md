It's surprising to know how the mind works.

I asked my uncle how he saw his memories, and he replied that he saw them as archives. When we asked him about his mom's name, He said that there were too many names that he couldn't see well. Then it he started moving his fingers, left hand, as if he was controling something, and only said that he was searching, and then he said, i found it, but the first time he couldn't read it. he said he was searching for it, The second time he said i found it and he was able to tell his mom's name. as if his mind was a computer searching for files in it's harddrive. It is highly posible that he has a photographic memory and that he accesses his memories in the form of archives (Folders). It gives me the impression that he is able to read words from this archives, or papers. It appears that he is able to read from this papers in a similar way as when we have multiple papers on our table, and are trying to read it without picking them up.

I asked him if he was able to save things in his archive, and he replied that he wasn't sure. I told him to save all his information somwhere safe where he can access it later after he wakes up.

We will see, hopefully after he wakes up if all his memories have returned, and if he is able to access his archive on free will alone.

It is also important to note that afterwards he felt preasure in his head, could be something similar to a migrane, because he was unable to see far and light felt too bright for him.

Another thing to record is that before any of this happened, he had a ice cube in his hand and it seemed that he was able to feel the heat from his body and tell how it melted the ice. He said, "every second a miligram of water melts"/"cada segundo un miligramo de hielo se derite con el calor de todo mi cuerpo". For some reason it seems as if for a moment he was in some type of high. He had a high perseption of sound, and maybe feeling, as in presence. (he was able to feel the presence of digital equipment like how fast the motherboard was running)

One other thing that was surprising is that he was able to detect the sound of computers even though they were really far away. he was able to tell that there were multiple computers(motherboards on).

When asked how many people he felt were in the room, he said that he couldn't tell, but he heard that sound of many hearts. He could even tell how our hearts felt. He said all of our hearts were scared. Given the situation, it was true we were all scared.
