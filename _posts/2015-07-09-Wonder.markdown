And so, I wonder: <br>
about everything,<br>
the world,<br>
me,<br>
You<br><br>

What makes you happy?<br>
What makes You sad?<br><br>

When you smile,<br>
What makes you smile?<br><br>


When you cry,<br>
What makes you cry?<br><br>


And so, selfishly I wonder,<br>
  if I can be the one who is responsible for all those things,<br><br>

I wonder,<br>
  when will I see see you smile again?<br>
  will it be a smile for me, or someone else?<br><br>

I wonder,<br>
  about all the things that make you who you are,<br>
  why you work so hard,<br>
  why you are so fun to be around.<br><br>

There are things I want to know about you,<br>
as there are thing I wish you knew about me.<br><br>

Share secrets,<br>
  laugh at all the things we have ever done, good and bad.<br><br>

I wonder,<br>
  if I can ever know every single detail about you,<br>
  if I could ever become someone who can always give you<br>
  what you need,<br>
  anything you want, <br>
  and everything you like,<br><br>

I wonder,<br>
if I can make you happy<br><br>

because you do.<br><br>

how?<br>
because it is you!!<br>
