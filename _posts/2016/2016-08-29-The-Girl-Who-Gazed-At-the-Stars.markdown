There she was, sitting under the night sky. A sky as blue as the ocean she was surrounded by. The brightness of the night cast shadows over her as if the night was protecting her from the cold gaze of the stars. The shadows embraced her, giving her a feeling of being protected. The night sky loved her and it would do anything to protect her, it would do anything to be gazed by her.

Her eyes as dark as the blue ocean pierced through the night sky, she gazed at it with so much love and wonder. She thought about the vastness of the sky, she thought about how blue it looked this particular night. To her knowledge, she didn't know that the night sky had been protecting her all this time. She didn't know she had a lover that always looked out of her, who sought to bring her happiness, who only wished to be seen by her beautiful eyes one more time.

The more she gazed at the night sky, the further her mind drifted into thought. The longer she gazed, the more beautiful the night sky became. The night sky loved her so much that it was willing  to show her all that was part of him. As she watched, the night sky was filled with the most beautiful and brightest colors a human eye can see, the sky had opened its heart and let her see everything that made it beautiful.

The night sky knew that there were many others who gazed at its vastness, but it didn't care if everyone knew the source of its beauty because it knew that as long as she gazed at the stars in his heart, she would love him. The night sky was truly under a spell cast by the waking sun, the spell wouldn't break unless he showed his lover all who he was, all that made him beautiful.

As she gazed at the night sky, she began to remember about a distant love that her heart ached for. The pain would fade when she gazed at the night sky, the same pain she felt would slowly turn into love. She loved the stars, in particular, she didn't know why but it reminded her of a time when she would be blinded by the clear and beautiful reflections she saw of herself at one point in the lifetime of her soul. When shadows were cast over her by the night sky, she would remember how warm and safe her heart felt as if she was been embraced by the one who she loved. She has never been able to remember who it was she loved. All she knew is that she could no longer feel the presence of her lover.

Every day she would wait eagerly for the night to come, she didn't know why gazing at the stars made her feel beautiful, she didn't know why the shadows cast  by the night sky made her feel safe, she felt at home. The longer she gazed at him, the more real he would become, the longer she gazed at him, the bigger her love would grow. Her mutual loved broke all limits, love suddenly had a new meaning. The waking sun had no longer any effect, they would no longer be apart.

The night sky had never looked as beautiful as it did that night. Two lovers lost in the vastness of time had finally found each other. The night sky felt proud and happy to be able to finally embrace the true source of its beauty, his missing heart.

The love she felt took away all her fears, the love he gave her, made her beautiful. She had finally found the place where she belonged. When she was just but another lost soul no one had taken notice of her, but now everyone had taken notice, everyone looked at her and became mesmerized by her beauty. All the love the night sky had for her had made her the most beautiful and brightest in the sky. Such is their love that every night somewhere around the world these two are always seen, she as pure and white as ever, embraced by its only lover, the night sky.
