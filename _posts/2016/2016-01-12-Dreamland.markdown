The idea of such a place is intriguing as it makes you wish you could go and stay there forever. In my case sometimes I think I am living in a world of dreams because she is always next to me.

Every day at any moment, she is right by my side, she is inside my head, she is everywhere. Every single instant, no matter what I do she is there. Sometimes her presence seems so real that it feels like she is the real one, although I know I am just day dreaming.

There are times when I can feel her presence somewhere around me, and there are times when I can perceive her scent, sometimes I can see her, sometimes I can hear her, and sometimes can see her smile, sometimes I can even see my self in her radiant eyes, and that's when I miss her, because I know she isn't real.

The real one is somewhere else, she is the one I truly miss, even though I see her every day while I dream, she is still never next to me.

I wish I could stop dreaming and make it all a reality,  I wish the one next to me was the real one,  but I am someone who is unable to break free from this world, I am unable to break free from this dream, unable to tell her how I truly feel, unable to tell her she is the one I need, I am unable to wrap my arms around her and tell her how dear she is to me.

I am stuck in this world, stuck in dreamland.
