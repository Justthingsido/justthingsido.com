I am at my happiest :

when I see you smile,

when I see you blush,

when I look at your lips,

when I look at you,

when I see myself in your radiant eyes.

<br>

I am at my happiest

when I am next to you,

when I know you are there next to me,

when I ask you a questions,

when I  hear your voice,

when my heart skips a beat.

<br>

I am at my happiest

when your presence brightens my day

when the coldest night becomes warmest because of you,

when I walk and know I don't have to look back, because I know you are at my side,

when I close my eyes and you are still there when I open them,

when I dream of you and the dream it's actually reality,

when you look into my eyes and my soul shivers of excitement,

when I have the opportunity of seeing you again,

when I Learn something knew about you,

when I realize I had made a friend,

a lifelong friend, someone I feel happy to have next to me,


<br>

I am at my happiest

when I walk you home,

when we say good night,

when I look back and  you look back at me,

when I know that it isn't the last time I will see you,

when I know there will be a tomorrow,

when I know that tomorrow you will once again bring me joy,

when I know I will be at my happiest,

when I know my heart and soul will feel the joy of having you next to me.
