There aren’t many things I can do, but there are many things I would like to do. I may have already told you many times that I really like you and that since the day I met you, somehow you have been on my mind all the time. What did you do to me? But I am glad, it has given me one more reason to look forward to every coming day.

I am not the type of person who likes to play around with other people's feelings, I am not the type of person who likes to hurt people because I know how much it hurts and how painful it is to be hurt by those who claim to _care about you._

When I met you, I was mesmerized by the fun person you seemed to be, I was shocked by the way you dance, shocked by how I danced, it was as if both of our bodies were in sync, as if they have known each other for a long time and are finally meeting again. That night it was the most awesome night I had ever had, and it was all because you were there.

Since that day, you have become someone of interest to me, every day I wondered about you and who you were, what you do, how you spend your days. I wanted to know you; I wanted to know everything that makes who you are.
Everyday my mind remembered how you looked that night, how much fun we had, but again my body screamed to have you next to me, it longed for everything of you.

I couldn't believe that I would have enough courage to call you and ask you out on a date. Never in my life have I done something like that. I am glad I did because that led us to meet again and the opportunity to get to know you better.

That day you became the most beautiful person I have ever met. You let someone you just met into your world, and I let you into mine. There was no need to keep appearances I could be myself all night and truly show you what I am, and I could see who you are. I heard your stories and you heard mine, I was shocked to see how much you and I have in common. "I can't believe I have met my twin soul,” I said to you. How is it possible for to people who met by chance to have that kind of connection.  

Those similarities were enough for you to become someone important to me, someone, I would be able to share the world with. With selfish reason, you became someone who I wanted to keep next to me, and of course someone who can be always there for you.

There aren't many things I can do for you, but I believe I have a lifetime to try my hardest and give you all you need. I can't offer you many things but I can gladly give you everything I am. I can care for you, I can miss you, I can long for you, I can wait for you, I can be there whenever you feel alone, I can be the last person to leave your side. I can be the one to love you forever.

There are many things I can't do, and there are a lot of things I can't offer you, but there is a whole world for me to explore and so many things for me to accomplish, Would you be willing to become my strength, to become my will, to be with me for a lifetime if not many, to spend every single happy and sad time together, to give each other strength, to cry, laugh, to play, to struggle, to enjoy the passing of time with me? If you are, then I will show you the world because that is all I have, and all I need for it to be complete is you.
