It is four in the morning, I should be sleeping right? Well, I am not. For some reason, every time I close my eyes you appear in my mind. You are all I can see, feel, and hear. Memories of you come to rushing to me as if they were desperate to be remembered.

It's is four in the morning, I should be sleeping, but I am not. Instead I have spent hours thinking of you. I am 100% sure you are the reason for my slumber tonight.

In this small world, people don't always have the chance or luck to find someone who shares the same interests, and does everything you have ever wished to do or have ever done. To me You are that kind of person, and because of that I have come to really like you. How do I know that? Well, It is four in the morning and I can't sleep because all I see when I close my eyes is you.

Normally, I am engulfed by cold bittersweet darkness every time I go to sleep. I am engulfed by the demons dwelling inside of me. All of my consciousness is torn apart by the hands of "Solitude" who has being my companion for far too long. But, today you are here in my mind. My body remembers your touch, your sweet scent, your smile, your voice, your beauty,  it remembers everything about you. Since the day I met you, it has being all about you.

Here I am, it is now 4:25 in the morning and wonder if falling for you was a mistake. I wonder if am a masochist who likes getting hurt over and over again. It's being only a day since i last heard of you. it's being just a day since I last felt electrified by the sound of your voice. Only a day has passed and I have already missed you an eternity. Why is my heart so stubborn and why did it have to fall for you? The joy you have brought to my life is so big that it's hurts to love someone like you.

It hurts because in this short period of time you have become someone who I would like to spend time with. I want to know what it is like to be next to you. I want to be there when you need someone, I want to be there just for you. There are hundreds of things you and I could do, but nothing would make me happier that just being right there next to you.

I want to hear your fallen heart beating for me, I want to see your blind eyes looking at me,
I want your soundless voice screaming for me. I want your numb body to long for me.

I want all of you to be mine, because all of mine is already yours. All you have to do is take it. It was my heart's fault, hundreds of times have a told him not to give you anything, but there he went and gave you all of him anyway. It has being one day since I last hear of you and my heart keeps longing for you, wishing for anything that is yours. My heart only wants the luxury of being yours. How hard is that to accomplish?

As hard as it may be, he won't give up that easily. My mind will always screams at him to stop, not to get hurt anymore. Even so, he will continue doing as he pleases because he knows what he is doing feels right, he might get trampled all over, he may get scared to love again, he might get a couple of scars, but he knows that it's feels right, because it is all for you and he loves you.

It is now 4:45 in the morning and during the last 32 hours that I have spent missing you, these 45 minutes have being the happiest so far, because just the memory of you seems to have being enough to make my heart stop longing for you, let me take over, and bandage his wounds so he is ready for a another day of struggle, hopes and joys, because I know he won't give up so easily. He will fight and mustering all courage he will try and reach out to you and selfishly tell you how much of a important person you have become to him, and how much he longs to see you each and everyday, to see how beautiful you become every time I fall for you.
