I wonder

about everything,

the world,

me,

You

<br>

What makes you happy?

What makes You sad?

<br>

When you smile,

What makes you smile?

<br>

When you cry,

What makes you cry?

<br>

Selfishly I wonder,

  if I can be the one who is responsible for all those things,

<br>

I wonder

  when will I see your smile again?

  will it be a smile for me, or someone else?

<br>

I wonder

  about all the things that make you who you are,

  why you work so hard,

  why you are so fun to be around.

<br>

There are things I want to know about you,

as there are things I wish you knew about me.

<br>

Share secrets,

  laugh at all the things we have ever done, good and bad.

<br>

I wonder

  if I can ever know every single detail about you,

  if I could ever become someone who can always give you

  what you need,

  anything you want,

  and everything you like,

<br>

I wonder,

if I can make you happy

because you do.
