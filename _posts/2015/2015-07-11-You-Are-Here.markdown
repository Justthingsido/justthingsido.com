Once again, here you are.

I wonder how long did it to pass before I met you again, it's has been an eternity for me.

Can you imagine how long I had to wait? To me, every second without you felt like forever.  
I used to say that I wanted to live forever,  
it was such a childish dream,
now I realize that if I could live forever and you weren't there, I wouldn't be able to live without you.

It's being a long time since I last so you, but there you are again. The most beautiful person I have ever being with. I wanted to tell you how gorgeous you look and how beautiful you are, but these words don't compare with the real you. I guess that makes me the luckiest person ever, because I found you!.

But now I wonder who you are. Every time I see you, you are different but then again the same person I learn to love over and over again. Again and again I wonder how long you will stay next to me, how long will it be this time. At some point you always disappear.

Over and over you disappear, over and over again I fall for you. Who are you, how can you make my heart so uneasy, how many times can you break it?

Here we are again, after so long, looking at each other, learning about each other,  going in adventures in each other's worlds. You make my heart jump up and down, you make my soul the most submissive, you can make me wait for you for an eternity. I may die, I may cry, I may long for you, for an eternity, deep down I know you are always coming back.

During all this time so many things have happened to me, but every single moment you were there with me. You may have been world's away but you were always with me.

But now, after so long,

You are here.
